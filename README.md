# Reliable-Transport-Protocols
In a given simulator, implement three reliable data transport protocols: Alternating-Bit (ABT), Go-Back-N (GBN), and Selective-Repeat (SR).

# Implementation

## Programming environment

You will write C (or C++) code that compiles under the GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) environment. Furthermore, you should ensure that your code compiles and operates correctly on the ONE host assigned to you by the course instructor (see section 3.2).

You should NOT use any machine other than the host assigned to you.


Your code should successfully compile using the version of gcc (for C code) or g++ (for C++ code) found on the host assigned to you and should function correctly when executed. Further, your implementation should NOT involve any disk I/O unless explicitly mentioned in the PA description.
